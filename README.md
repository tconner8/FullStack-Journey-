# Full-Stack Developer Journey 
## About Me
I am an emerging full-stack software engineer currently learning web development from the ground up.
## Goal 
My Goal is to become a Full-Stack Software Developer, begin freelancing, and eventually secure a full-time role. 
## Tech Stack (In progress) 
-HTML
-CSS
-JAVASCRIPT
-REACT
-NODE.JS
-EXPRESS
-DATABASE (TBD)
## Progress Log 
-Day 1: Enviorment setup and Github repository created.
-Day 2  Index.html and import from VS code to Github.
-Day 3  Git basics (add, commit, push), handling merge conflicts, HTML nesting & structure. 
-Day 4  CSS, HTML styling/structuring, live server previews, Git workflows (classes, div). more stage, commit, push work.
-Day 5  Link HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(.js), listened for user events, change text, styles dynamically, debugged mistakes, commit + push.
-Day 6 Variables, functions, function calls, event driven logic, Reading and trusting console.
-Day 7 if/ else, state with booleans, functions + events, scope (global vs local), why errors happen.
-Day 8 Use parameters, pass arguments, reuse functions, Read + refactor code.
-Day 9 Implemented array-based logic, removed redundant if/else code, cleaned up text/color handling.
-Day 10 Implemented object-based UI logic, fixed broken data, improved stlying control.
-Day 11 Dynamic DOM creation, correct placement, mental model practice
-Day 12 Dynamic list rendered, reading console errors, traced null references
-Day 13 Event listeners, dynamic DOM updates, state driven UI, preventing duplications.
-Day 14 Remove elements from the page, update state (the array), re-render UI correctly, understand why "remove" ≠ "hide".
-Day 15 Button owns add behavior, list items own remove behavior, splice updates data, renderList() refreshes UI, console.log is a learning/debug tool, removing ≠ error, its behavior change.
-Day 16 Clicked -> toggle behavior, fixed CSS typo, js + DOM interplay.
-Day 17 Upgraded data structure, connected state -> UI.
-Day 18 Added visual feedback using selected CSS class
-Day 19 Reading console errors, fixing HTML syntax, structuring files properly, managing arrays of objects, re-rendering dynamic lists.
-Day 20 Extracted logic into a function, rewired event listeners, kept behavior intact, did not break any codes this time around.
-Day 21 Persistence state, JSON stringify/parse, auto save on render, load on startup.
-Day 22 Higher order array methods(filter), state reassignment, persistence still working automatically.
-Day 23 Continuing day 22 multiple UI states, conditional rendering filtered views of state, arch seperation.
-Day 24 Removed malfunctioning "All" button from UI.
-Day 25 Stabilize list rendering and filter behavior.
